# Sorting
## In real life
 - Insertion Sort
    - Easy Algorithm.
 - Merge Sort
    - Always O(nlog(n)) and it is stable which means that is always gives the same results in order (*Space complexity(O(n)) is a little bit highter than Quick Sort (O(log(n)))
 - Quick Sort(Pick Pivot properly)
    - To use when your average case performance matters more than the worst case performance because it quicksort allows us ot sort in O(nlog(n)) (*WorstCase : O(n^2))

## You want to teach sorting for the first time
